## Goal üèÜ

Develop an application to solve problems with [AHP algorithm](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/analytic-hierarchy-process-prioritize-projects-6608).



## Guidelines üßæ

The graphical interface must be able to handle:

* Alternatives
* Criteria
* Preference relationships (comparison of to pairs of criteria and alternatives)



The algorithm must be able to calculate:

* Consistency indices (CI)
* Ratios of consistency (CR)
* Eigenvalues
* Eigenvectors
* Priority vectors
* Ranking
